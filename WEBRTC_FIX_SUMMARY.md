## WebRTC Call Flow Fix Summary

### Problem
Users receiving incoming calls get "Cannot answer call: Missing offer in callInfo" error when clicking answer button. The issue is that WebRTC offers are not reaching the recipient's Chat component.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Signal Timing Issue**: WebRTC offers were being sent before the recipient was ready to receive them
2. **Call Reference Management**: The `currentCallRef` was not being set properly for incoming calls
3. **State Synchronization**: The call state between Chat component and useWebRTC hook was not synchronized

### Implemented Fixes

#### 1. Enhanced Signal Handling in useWebRTC Hook
- Added `pendingOffer` state to store incoming offers when no peer connection exists
- Enhanced `handleIncomingSignal` to validate and store offers properly
- Improved `answerCall` to wait for pending offers with timeout
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

#### 2. Call Reference Management
- Added `setCurrentCallRef` function to useWebRTC hook
- Modified Chat component to set current call reference when receiving incoming calls
- Ensured proper cleanup of call references when calls end

#### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added validation for signal data structure
- Better error messages and logging
- Proper cleanup on call failures

#### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- Added detailed logging throughout the call flow
- Structured logging with emojis for easy identification
- Global error handling in main.jsx

### Test Instructions
1. Login with two different users in separate browser tabs/windows
2. User A initiates a call to User B
3. Check console logs for:
   - "ðŸš€ INITIATING CALL" from User A
   - "ðŸŽ¯ CALL:INITIATED EVENT RECEIVED" from User A
   - "ðŸ“¨ Received incoming signal" from User B
   - "ðŸ’¾ Storing offer for later use" from User B
4. User B clicks answer button
5. Check console logs for:
   - "ðŸ“ž Answering call" from User B
   - "ðŸŽ‰ Found matching offer" from User B
   - Call should connect successfully

### Files Modified
1. `frontend/hooks/useWebRTC.jsx` - Enhanced signal handling and call management
2. `frontend/src/components/user/Chat.jsx` - Improved call state management
3. `frontend/src/main.jsx` - Added global error handling
4. `backend/socket/socket.js` - Enhanced signal forwarding (already correct)

### Next Steps
If the issue persists, check:
1. Browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Network tab for failed WebSocket connections
3. Backend logs for signal forwarding
4. Ensure both users have microphone permissions
